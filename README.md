Welcome to Game Collection Project by Jonathan Norman.
This is my Sinatra Portfolio Project.

With this application users are able to maintain a list of desired games and consoles as well as a list of their owned games and consoles.
Users are able to signup and login seeing only games and consoles that they add to their respective lists.
Games and consoles can be added to the wish list to be later moved to the owned list or be directly added to the owned list if they already own it.
Games and consoles can be added to the owned list directly from the wish list as well.
All games and consoles can be removed from their show pages whether they are on the wish list or owned list.

In order to install this application you will need to do the following.
Once you have copied the clone SSH from github you will need to cd into the game-collection-project folder.
Bundle install will then need to be run.
Run shotgun in the terminal and you will be off and running.

Gems that I used in this application.
I used the corneal gem http://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/ to create the base application.
I used the sinatra-flash gem with help from SFEley/sinatra-flash to create the flash messages for errors or successes.
